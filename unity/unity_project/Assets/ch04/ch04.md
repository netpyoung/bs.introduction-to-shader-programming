* foward rendering
  - single pass, multi light

for object in objects:
    for light in lights:
        framebuffer = light_model(object, light);

  - multi pass, multi light

for light in lights:
    for object in apply(light, objects):
        framebuffer = framebuffer + light_model(object, light);

* defered rendering
  - defered shading

for object in objects:
    g-buffer = get_light_properties(object)

for light in lights:
    framebuffer = framebuffer + light_model(g-buffer, light)
