# Techniques
* Phong
* Lambert
* Half Lambert

* Blinn-Phong: a technique that is very similar to Phong.
* Oren-Nayar: a diffuse lighting technique that takes account of the roughness of a surface.
* Cook-Torrance: a specular lighting technique that takes account of the roughness of a surface.
* Spherical Harmonics Lighting: once indirect lighting is pre-calculated offline, it can be applied in real-time.


# PBS(physical based shader)
Oren - Nayar - 거칠게하기 - phong은 너무 매끈거림
Blinn - Phong Specuar
Anisotropic
Fresnel effect : Snell's Law
IBL(image based light)
